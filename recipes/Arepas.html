  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These arepas have a crispy crust while the cheese inside stays melty and gives you that cheese-pull that everyone knows and loves.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups warm water</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
    <li>¼ cup canola oil, divided</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Steps to Fallow</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Shred 3 ounces of the mozzarella and cut remaining 5 ounces into 1/2-inch cubes. Transfer shredded cheese to a large bowl and cubed cheese to a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Add cornmeal, 1 teaspoon salt, and warm water to the shredded cheese and mix to combine. Set aside for 10 minutes to allow cornmeal to absorb liquid. The mixture should resemble soft Play-Doh.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
    <li>With damp palms and fingers, place 1/4 cup arepa mixture into your palm and flatten into a 2 1/2-inch disk. Place 3 to 4 cubes of the mozzarella into the center. Gently fold edges of dough over to cover mozzarella cubes completely, patting to form a cake. Repeat until all dough and cheese has been used.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 3 or 4 arepas and cook until both sides are golden brown and charred in spots, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove to a parchment-lined baking sheet and season with a pinch of the remaining salt. Place in the preheated oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining oil, arepas, and salt.</li>
  </ol>
